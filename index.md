Hi my name is Julian Cardiel and I am a computer science major at CSUF and plan on graduating in 2028.

## Favorite Labs in CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 4, Part 2:
  In this lab we started using If and else statements which was something I really enjoyed using in my code. At first I was so confused with how the brackets worked with the if statements then including and else statement right after. After I caught on it was really easy to include into my work and the most impactful. The game we created, which is guessing the secret number, was not challenging yet something enjoyable. Like I said just learning the concept of else and If statements were for sure was something that will always stick to me.

* Lab 7, part 1:
  In this lab we got introduced to bool statements, still adjusting to else and if statements,
And using arguments as well. We were able to code when a car can be able to park somewhere on a certain day and a certain time and when they can not be parked on the street. For some reason when we first received the lab I was so lost and trying to understand how to include from what time cars can be parked and when they can't be until i read the instructions. I started using the or statements which were very different from the and statements and I caught on after a while since that was the first mistake I made when coding the lab. Other than that, it was very enjoyable and a bit of a long process.

* Lab 8, part 2:
  In this lab we were introduced to for loops which I struggled so much with trying to understand the concept. I remember seeing an example during class being so lost then when I went To SI learning, Johnny explained very well and was able to help me understand the concept of a  for loop. When I completed this lab, it was so short but cool to see how a for loop is in action. Just with this lab I was able to understand what a for loop is capable of doing before even getting into while and do loops, break, and continue. This will definitely be something that I can include for future projects that I'd like to do throughout the summer for sure.
